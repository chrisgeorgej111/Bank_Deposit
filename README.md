# Bank_Deposit
Predicting which customer has likely deposited or not

This imbalanced dataset has several features regarding the personal details of the customers and actions taken by the bank to reach out to the customer for a likely deposit.

First of all Data preprocessing and basic analysis of which sort of customers have a deposit to help us to target those sort of customers.

Since this dataset has output with two classes I have chosen several classification models along with Random undersampler to balance the dataset and trained them..

I have evaluated models based on some classification metrics like recall score, f1 score, confusion matrix.. 

Among all the models chosen, Random Forest works the best.
